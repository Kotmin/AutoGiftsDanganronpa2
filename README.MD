There may already be a function to do what you're looking for, but I don't know about it (yet?). In the meantime, I would suggess using:

ran_floats = numpy.random.rand(50) * (13.3-0.5) + 0.5
This will produce an array of shape (50,) with a uniform distribution between 0.5 and 13.3.

NOTE: You must install tkinter on Linux to use MouseInfo. Run the following: sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-dev
